# Patient Scheduling Program #

The patient scheduling program is the final project for my first object-oriented programming class in Java (Fall 2015). Some of the code is modified from an example provided by my professor, Tarek Sayed at the University of Miami. 

The program reads an XML file which contains patient, doctor, and visit information. Using a read and write method, the program allows for updates to the XML data. The Graphic User Interface (GUI) is created using Swing.

I am posting this repo and will continue to make changes as I learn to write cleaner and better code. I am currently reading *Clean Code* by Robert C. Martin.
